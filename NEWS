# osrm version 3.0.2 (Release date: 2017-06-08)

## Minor changes
* set the grid size for computing isochrones in osrmIsochrone (more precise isopleth maps)
* fix osrmTrip


# osrm version 3.0.1 (Release date: 2017-03-31)

## Minor changes
* Enable changing the profile via options(osrm.profile = "name.of.the.profile")(driving is set by default).  
* Small fixes and adaptations to the API (in osrmTrip  mainly)






# osrm version 3.0.0 (Release date: 2016-05-10)

This is a major release. Changes have been made to reflect the evolution of the OSRM routing service/engine.
The backward compatibility is not ensured. The osrm package works with the version 5.0.0 of the OSRM API.


## Major changes:
* osrmViaroute is suppressed, use osrmRoute with `overview = FALSE` instead.
* osrmViarouteGeom is replaced by osrmRoute. osrmRoute offers simplified or detailed (full) route geometry via `overview` parameter. 
* Functions now accept sp objects and data.frames.
* Add osrmIsochrone. This function computes a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame of isochrones.
* Add osrmTrip. This function gets the travel geometry between multiple unordered points.
* Under the hood: some function now use google encoded polylines via gepaf package. 



# osrm version 2.0.0 (Release date: 2016-01-20)


This is a major release. Changes have been made to reflect the evolution of the OSRM routing service/engine.
The backward compatibility is not ensured. The osrm package works with the version 4.9.0 of the OSRM API.

## Major changes:
* Supression of osrmTableOD and osrmTableErrors
* Different parameters names and output in each functions
* XML and reshape2 packages are no longer imported


# osrm version 1.1 (Release date: 2015-11-06)

## Changes:
* Install instruction in README
* Add a SpatialLinesDataFrame export to the osrmViaRouteGeom
* Add the \dontrun{} instruction to all examples due to potential public API downtime and to prevent excessive use of the public API via  regular checks.
