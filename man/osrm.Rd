\title{Shortest Paths and Travel Time from OpenStreetMap via an OSRM API}
\description{
An interface between R and the OSRM API. OSRM is a routing
service based on OpenStreetMap data. See <http://project-osrm.org/> for more
information. A public API exists but one can run its own instance. This package
allows to compute distances (travel time and kilometric distance) between points
and travel time matrices..\cr
This package relies on the usage of a running OSRM service (tested with 
version 4.9.0 of the OSRM API).\cr
By default this service is the OSRM public API (http://router.project-osrm.org/).
To change the OSRM server, change the \code{osrm.server} option:\cr 
\code{options(osrm.server = "http://address.of.the.server/")}. \cr
\itemize{
\item{\code{\link{osrmTable}} Get travel time matrices between points.}
\item{\code{\link{osrmViaroute}} Get travel time and travel distance between two points.}
\item{\code{\link{osrmViarouteGeom}} Get the travel geometry between two points.}
}
